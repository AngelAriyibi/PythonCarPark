# PythonCarPark
In this project I developed a text-based program (without a graphicaluser interface (GUI)), then I used a TKinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) for both input and output, rather than the text-based console.

The program does as followed:
1. At the start of the program, a parking record file is read, which is a CSV file (in this case Excel).
2. The program keeps track of the number of available parking spaces and the parking space identifier of each vehicle.
3. The program displays the number of remaining available parking spaces every time a vehicle enters or exits the car park and the parking space identifier assigned to
any vehicle.
4. The program allows customers to query their parking ticket and view available parking spaces
5. The program charges a parking fee of Â£2 an hour
